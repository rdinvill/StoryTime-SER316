So there I was, in the ratskeller eating baeckerei...
I knew that I needed to be at the Flughafen in Berlin in under an hour or else I would miss my flight.
So I got into my Porsche and raced down the Hauptstrasse.
With one hand on the steering wheel, and the other holding my Apfelkuchen, I navigated the narrow streets toward the Autobahn.
I raced for Berlin at 300kph thirsting for the Biergarten and Lederhose shopping.  
After my little stop at the Biergarten I had a sudden craving for a Gebaeck.
I decided to go to the baeckerei at the Schloss where they have the biggest selection of gebaeck that I know. 
At the Schloss I met one of my favorite teachers from asu, professor Mehlhase, who was eating a Apfelkuchen.
