So there I was, in the ratskeller eating baeckerei...
I knew that I needed to be at the Flughafen in Berlin in under an hour or else I would miss my flight.
So I got into my Porsche and raced down the Hauptstrasse.
With one hand on the steering wheel, and the other holding my Apfelkuchen, I navigated the narrow streets toward the Autobahn.
I raced for Berlin at 300kph thirsting for the Biergarten and Lederhose shopping.  
After my little stop at the Biergarten I had a sudden craving for a Gebaeck.
I decided to go to the baeckerei at the Schloss where they have the biggest selection of gebaeck that I know. 
At the Schloss I met one of my favorite teachers from asu, professor Mehlhase, who was eating a Apfelkuchen.
I told the professor, my homework is incomplete because my klimaanlage broke down last night and I couldn't sleep; 'worry not,' she said, and we loaded my klimaanlage into the back of her BMW to take to the repair shop.
With my klimaanlage successfully repaired, the professor and I celebrated with a gebaeck from the baeckerei and a mehlhase.
Just then, my favorite song "Du Hast" came on the radio and I shouted, "Ich liebe Rammstein!"
I put on my best dirndl and engaged in a spirited bout of wettbewerbsfaehig moshing with my fellow Rammheads.
Much to my surprise, some hunds even joined in!
I thought the hunds were sweet so I gave them some brot.
Afterwards, I also treated myself by buying some doeners.
But the Brot was a little soggy... So I requested an exchange from the Baeckerei for a French baguette instead.
